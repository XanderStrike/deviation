These kids loved\n                having their picture taken. Loved it. My fellow photographer Charlie and I always\n                joked, \"you can take as many pictures of the kids as you want, as long as you show\n                them every single one.\" It was true, there&#039;s some incredible allure to\n                seeing yourself frozen in time on a tiny screen.<br /><br />The next few\n                pictures (as I get to them) are portraits of second or third generation Hatian\n                refugees. Some of them knew I was taking their picture, others don&#039;t. To\n                me, at least, these photos carry such emotion and meaning. Many are even hard to\n                look at.<br /><br />An interesting note. The children only put on the\n                stern or uncomfortable faces when my lens was pointed at them. At all other times\n                their smiles were huge. The only way I ever got pictures of smiling children was\n                when they didn&#039;t know I was taking their picture.<br /><br\n                /><br />These boys and a few others had just put on an amazing show of\n                acrobatics for us. They could all do flawless cartwheels, and a couple could do... I\n                think they&#039;re called handsprings? or backsprings? I&#039;m not sure.

We ran into two other\n                groups, World Servants and Orphanage Outreach who are also going to the Dominican\n                Republic, I wonder if that flight is always full of missionaries, there&#039;s\n                only one flight from the US into the DR each week so it probably is.

This is cool and all, I like to\n                see my work getting around, but I&#039;d like to get some recognition out of it\n                (being as egocentric as I am).<br /><br />In this vein, I&#039;m\n                thinking about adding those annoying little copyright notices somewhere on my image.\n                Watermarks are obviously out of the question because they make my picture look like\n                shit and indicate extraordinary dickery, so that leaves boarders and such.<br\n                /><br />I like the simplicity of a single little strip off to the side, but\n                I&#039;d like your thoughts. Yay? Nay?<br /><br />Putting them on is\n                extra work for me, but if it brings more views to my DA without degrading the\n                quality of my image it&#039;s something I&#039;m down for.

    "description": "Ladies and gentlemen of DeviantArt, I think I&#039;m in\n                love.<br /><br />There&#039;s a place down the street from where I\n                live that has a magnificent view of the mountains on the west side of the valley,\n                and the sky above them. A lot of my sky/sunset pictures (most of the ones without a\n                big palm tree in them) come from there.<br /><br />So today,\n                I&#039;m driving home admiring the sunset fireworks and thinking about dropping\n                by. I turn the corner and start driving up the hill to the spot (it&#039;s on my\n                way home anyway) and I notice someone standing very still there.<br /><br\n                />I&#039;m thinking why they could be there, there&#039;s no real reason\n                to go there unless...<br /><br />Then she turns around and\n                she&#039;s holding Nikon D80 with this gigantic telephoto lens and an even\n                larger hood.<br /><br /><img\n                src=\"emojis/biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"\n                alt=\":D\" title=\":D (Big Grin)\" /><br /><br />So apparently she lives\n                around here and saw me taking pictures there on her way someplace and thought\n                it&#039;d be a good idea. I&#039;M AN INSPIRATION TO OTHERS!<br\n                /><br />LEVEL UP! +2 AWESOME!<br /><br /><br />(oh and\n                also this is a picture of clouds and things)",
