    <h1>Deviation</h1>
    <div id="foreword">
        From 2008 to 2010 I maintained an active DeviantArt presence. I posted
        hundreds of "deviations" (artworks), but I also built community,
        connection, and meaning with the other users there. DA was my first real
        taste of social media, with all its good and ill. The images here are
        merely the works I posted, they are divorced from the social likes and
        comments that gave them significance to me at the time.
